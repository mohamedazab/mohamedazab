### Mohamed Elzohairy


 HelloðŸ‘‹!
 
I am Mohamed. I have been working as a Global Software Architect at Dassault Systems for more than 4 years. From a young age, I've been drawn to problem-solving, which has shaped my proactive approach to addressing potential issues. I specialize in applying architecture and design patterns to devise innovative solutions, architecting scalable applications, and swiftly adapting to new technologies and languages.

My specialties include utilizing architecture and design patterns to create novel and innovative solutions, designing and architecting scalable applications, and acquiring new skills quickly. Proficient in Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as relational and non-relational databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL, I bring expertise in cloud computing, DevOps, and agile methodologies to the table. 

Moreover, my analytical skills and careful planning allow me to anticipate potential issues and address them proactively during the design and architecture phase.
